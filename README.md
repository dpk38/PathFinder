# PathFinder

Machine Learning based Evolutionary Algorithmic Path Finder

Used Genetic Algorithms to simulate the Biological Phenomenon of Natural Selection, Mutation, Crossover. 
A set of rockets from an initial random population learn to find their way to a target over many generations, learning from their previous experiences. The track has multiple obstacles that the rockets have to avoid in order to reach the target. After each generation, rockets with the best fitness are chosen and added to mating pool. 
Over multiple generations, the rockets eventually "learn" to avoid the obstacles and reach the target. 
Fitness is calculated as the measure of how close a rocket reached to the target. 
Mutation is introduced to avoid getting stuck at a local maxima.
